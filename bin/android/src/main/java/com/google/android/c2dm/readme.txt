This is third-party code and originates in //enterprise_mobile/main/cooper/thirdparty/google/c2dm/.
Updates from Google should be applied there, and then integrated here with a command like:

p4 integrate //enterprise_mobile/main/cooper/thirdparty/google/c2dm/com/... //enterprise_mobile/main/cooper/aes/sdk/android/src/main/java/com/...

(or GUI equivalent).
